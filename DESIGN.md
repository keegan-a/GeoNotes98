# Design Intent

GeoNotes 98 is a space between thought and action — an echo of a time when software invited us to explore. The goal is not productivity, but presence. Every sound, color, and delay is intentional — a reminder that slowing down is not failure, but alignment.

## Emotional pillars

- **Hope through agency** — Users see progress because *they* added a layer, not because a streak counter approved.
- **Joy through discovery** — Wallpapers, stickers, and gentle animations reward curiosity.
- **Compassion through non-judgment** — Language avoids praise or guilt. Status messages whisper, “Saved quietly,” or “There’s time to return.”
- **Mystery through delight** — Ambient reflections surface periodically without demanding attention.

## Visual system

- **Palette** — Soft off-whites, twilight violets, and teal accents. Pastel warmth keeps the desk breathable.
- **Textures** — Light grain on chrome, drifting stickers, and backgrounds that subtly respond to time of day.
- **Motion** — Stickers sway with idle drift; buttons lift gently on hover. Motion is slow, giving eyes time to rest.
- **Typography** — IBM Plex Sans for clarity, DM Serif Display for titles, Fira Code for monospaced details. Mixed weights feel editorial yet approachable.

## Sound design

- **Save** — A soft page-turn tone acknowledges completion without fanfare.
- **Click** — A gentle tap signals focus changes and new notes.
- **Clock tick** — Subtle sine ping on minute changes (after initial user interaction) anchors the moment.
- Volume is intentionally low and respectful of quiet spaces.

## Copy tone

- Speak in reflective fragments (“Notes are patient places.”).
- Avoid congratulatory messaging or gamified prompts.
- Use inclusive language that invites returning without pressure.

## Interaction patterns

- **Notes** — Windows resemble retro chrome with rounded edges and soft shadows. Title fields glow on hover (“attention is care”).
- **Stickers** — Added through a simple drawer. Dragging feels analog; idle stickers drift a few pixels to mimic paper shifting.
- **Themes** — Treat palettes as mood shifts; changing theme gently updates wallpaper, icons, and soundpack.
- **Export** — Labelled “Export desk” to reinforce ownership. Resulting HTML opens as a personal time capsule.

## Accessibility intentions

- High contrast text and keyboard-accessible components.
- Status updates announced visually (and via ARIA live regions in the UI layer).
- Shortcut friendly (Ctrl/Cmd+S saves a note; Tab order respects reading flow).

Design should always reinforce calm ownership. GeoNotes 98 is a desk that listens more than it speaks.
